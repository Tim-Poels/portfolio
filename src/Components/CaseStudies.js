              but because a couple of classmates really liked my animations 
              I decided to create a npm package that exports them as React components.
              These Components are easy to manipulate trough props (color, size, animation speed, ect...) so that they can be used in any situation.
              I am still working on this and am hoping to publish it by the end of the summer."

            and I tought to myself: "I can do that too!"
            I started working on it with the suspicion that this was done with pseudo elements and some skew() propperties. 
            After a day of playing around and banging my head against my desk, 
            I figured out how skew() works and started getting some results, 
            a day later I had finished, but I wasn't satisfied with the results yet. 
            I didn't like that it was static and the colors didn't fit in my mind.
            After playing around with it and adding an animation, I was happy with it. 
            The only thing that doesn't work as well on here as on the project file is the fact that when you press on of the boxes it just redirects you back to this site, 
            since I just ripped it out of that project.`}
